    <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>"I am Sylvia Mwitumi, a accomplished Kenyan entrepreneur boasting a diverse skill set spanning customer service, marketing, commercial law, forensic science, criminology, legal writing, and ICT law. I've showcased strong leadership, research, and training skills in successfully founding and managing two companies. In 2018, I co-founded Fundis, connecting users with skilled artisans, and in 2021, I launched Chuuza, a mobile platform linking users to professional local service providers. Through Chuuza, my mission is to empower excluded young women for financial freedom. Armed with a Bachelor of Arts in Security Management and Criminology, along with legal studies qualifications, I've garnered accolades such as the 2019 Global Student Entrepreneurship (GSEA) winner, the 2020 Challenge of 1000 Laurette winner, and a two-time Africarena semi-finalist. Committed to empowering young women and creating job opportunities, I'm excited to lead transformative work in revolutionizing work dynamics within the African informal sector using technology enablers."</p>
